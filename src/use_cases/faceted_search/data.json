      "description": "Field Methods:\n   Birds will be captured via passive mist netting as well as by using target taxa song playbacks. The use of species-specific song playbacks will reduce the potential for incidental captures. From each target taxa, we will take two tail feathers and one drop (~50ul) of blood from the subbrachial wing vein. From incidental captures we will sample 2 tail feathers. All captured birds will be affixed with a metal, government issued bird band. Any birds showing signs of stress will be released without processing or banding. Nets will be placed so they do not catch the direct sun and will be checked three times per hour. Netting will not be conducted in excessive hot, cold, wet or windy conditions.",
